        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>townoflexingtoncommerce.com</p>
        <p>The overall goal of the chamber of commerce site is to promote the business interests of the members of the organization and promote the area, attracting additional business, tourism, and people. For this reason, the Town of Lexington has concracted me to assist in building their website. This is the wireframe which will soon become the main website. Feel free to look around and email your towns representatives for suggestions.</p>
